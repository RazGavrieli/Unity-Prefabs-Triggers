# Unity week 2: Formal elements

* [Play the game on itch](https://ggm-gamedev.itch.io/asteroids)
<br>
This game was edited by me (Raz Gavrieli), original game by Erel Segal-Halevi. <br>
I've added audio components, an additional - more difficult - level, improved sprites, life system (HP), and win\lose screen. <br>
